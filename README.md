# ProductivityAssistant

Android prototype for a multi-user Pomodoro timer with customizable focus cycles and on-device data persistence.

> ⚠️ This project is a **functional prototype** built for academic and learning purposes.  
> It focuses on demonstrating core Pomodoro timer logic and local user session handling rather than production-ready features.

## Project Overview

ProductivityAssistant is an Android application prototype designed to help students improve focus and time management using the Pomodoro technique.

The app allows users to:
- Create local user profiles on a single device
- Run Pomodoro-based focus sessions with configurable work and break cycles
- Track session progress and productivity summaries

## Core Concept

The application is built around a customizable Pomodoro workflow.  
Users can define their own focus cycles (work duration, short breaks, long breaks, and repetition count) instead of being limited to a fixed Pomodoro preset.
